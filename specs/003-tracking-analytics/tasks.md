## Notes

### Security Reminders
- All financial fields MUST be encrypted before database storage
- User ownership validation required on all tracking endpoints
- Rate limiting on expensive operations (analytics, comparison)
- No plain-text financial data in logs or error messages

### Performance Targets
- Snapshot creation: <300ms
- Payment recording: <200ms
- Analytics dashboard load: <2s
- Comparison query: <500ms
- PDF generation: <3s (client-side)

### Islamic Compliance
- Dual calendar support (Gregorian + Hijri) in all date fields
- Islamic recipient categories in payment recording
- Methodology-aware calculations
- Nisab threshold tracking

### Testing Strategy
- TDD approach: All tests (Phase 3.2) before implementation (Phase 3.3+)
- Contract tests validate API contracts match tracking-api.yaml
- Integration tests validate user scenarios from spec.md
- Unit tests validate business logic in services and utilities
- E2E tests validate complete workflows from quickstart.md
- Manual testing validates real-world usability

### Git Workflow
- Commit after each phase checkpoint (marked with 🔸)
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Never commit: `*.db`, `*.db-journal`, `*.enc`, `.env`, `*/data/`
- Each commit should represent a logical milestone
