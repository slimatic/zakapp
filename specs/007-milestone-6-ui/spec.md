**I want** the application to work with screen readers and support keyboard navigation  
**So that** I can independently calculate my Zakat obligations without assistance

**As a** user with motor disabilities  
**I want** all interactive elements to be keyboard-accessible with visible focus indicators  
**So that** I can navigate the application without requiring precise mouse control

**As a** user with color blindness  
**I want** information to be conveyed through more than just color  
**So that** I can understand all visual information and status indicators

#### 2. Performance for All Users
**As a** user on a slow internet connection  
**I want** pages to load quickly and show content progressively  
**So that** I can use the application even with limited bandwidth

**As a** mobile user  
**I want** the application to be responsive and lightweight  
**So that** I don't consume excessive data or experience slow performance

#### 3. Progressive Web App Experience
**As a** frequent user  
**I want** to install the application on my device and use it offline  
**So that** I can access my Zakat calculations anytime, even without internet

**As a** user planning for Zakat payment  
**I want** to receive timely reminders even when the app isn't open  
**So that** I never miss my Zakat obligations

#### 4. User Experience Quality
**As a** new user  
**I want** the application to be intuitive and easy to navigate  
**So that** I can complete my Zakat calculation without confusion or errors

**As a** returning user  
**I want** consistent, predictable behavior across all features  
**So that** I can efficiently complete my tasks

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - **Given** a user navigating with keyboard only
   - **When** they press Tab to move through interactive elements
   - **Then** all buttons, links, and form fields receive visible focus indicators in logical order

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - **Given** a blind user with screen reader enabled
   - **When** they navigate any page of the application
   - **Then** all content, images, buttons, and form fields have appropriate labels and descriptions

3. **Color Contrast**
   - **Given** a user viewing any page
   - **When** examining text and interactive elements
   - **Then** all text meets minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text)

4. **Text Resizing**
   - **Given** a user who needs larger text
   - **When** they zoom to 200% or adjust browser text size
   - **Then** all content remains readable without horizontal scrolling or overlapping

5. **Form Validation**
   - **Given** a user submitting a form with errors
   - **When** validation fails
   - **Then** error messages are clearly associated with fields, announced to screen readers, and don't rely solely on color

#### Performance Optimization

6. **Initial Page Load**
   - **Given** a user accessing the application on 3G connection (simulated: 1.6 Mbps download, 750 Kbps upload, 150ms RTT)
   - **When** landing page loads
   - **Then** First Contentful Paint occurs within 1.5 seconds

7. **Interactive Response**
   - **Given** a user performing any action (clicking, typing, navigating)
   - **When** action is triggered
   - **Then** visual feedback appears within 100ms and action completes within 2 seconds

8. **Resource Optimization**
   - **Given** any page in the application
   - **When** measuring bundle size and assets
   - **Then** initial JavaScript bundle is under 200KB gzipped, images are optimized and lazy-loaded

9. **Core Web Vitals**
   - **Given** Google Lighthouse audit on any page
   - **When** performance metrics are calculated
   - **Then** scores are: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1, Performance score ≥90 (90-100 range considered passing)

#### Progressive Web App Features

10. **Installation**
    - **Given** a user visiting the application on mobile or desktop
    - **When** they choose to install the app
    - **Then** application installs as standalone app with proper icon and splash screen

11. **Offline Functionality**
    - **Given** a user who has previously used the application
    - **When** they open the app without internet connection
    - **Then** they can view previously loaded data and see appropriate offline messages

12. **Service Worker Updates**
    - **Given** an application update is deployed
    - **When** user returns to the application
    - **Then** new version is downloaded in background and user is prompted to refresh

13. **Web Push Notifications**
    - **Given** a user who has granted push notification permission
    - **When** a Zakat payment reminder is due
    - **Then** push notification appears even when app is closed

#### User Experience Testing

14. **Task Completion Rate**
    - **Given** 10 new users attempting to calculate Zakat
    - **When** observed in usability testing
    - **Then** at least 8 users complete the task without assistance

15. **Error Recovery**
    - **Given** a user who encounters an error
    - **When** error message is displayed
    - **Then** message clearly explains the problem and provides actionable recovery steps

16. **User Satisfaction**
    - **Given** users completing key tasks (asset management, Zakat calculation)
    - **When** surveyed about experience
    - **Then** average satisfaction score is 4.0 or higher out of 5.0

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** user has very slow device (low-end mobile)?
  - Application remains responsive with minimal animations
  - Heavy computations show progress indicators

- **What happens when** multiple large assets are being loaded?
  - Progressive loading prioritizes above-fold content
  - Lazy loading prevents blocking

#### PWA Features

  - Least recently used data is removed automatically
  - User is notified if critical data cannot be cached

- **What happens when** user denies push notification permission?
  - Application continues to function normally
  - In-app reminders remain available
