# Frequently Asked Questions

Based on the "Simple Zakat Guide" video series by Sheikh Joe Bradford.

## 1. General Principles & Basics

**Q: What is Zakat?**
A: Zakat is a mandatory charitable contribution and the third pillar of Islam. It serves as a purification for your wealth and a means of social welfare. It is not a tax on income, but a charge on accumulated surplus wealth held for a specific period.

**Q: Who must pay Zakat?**
A: Every Muslim who owns wealth that meets or exceeds the Nisab (minimum threshold) and has held that wealth for a full lunar year (Hawl) must pay Zakat. The wealth must be:
- Fully owned and under your control.
- In excess of your basic personal needs.
- Productive or capable of growth (e.g., cash, gold, investments, inventory).

**Q: What is the Nisab?**
A: The Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth you must possess to be liable for Zakat.
- Gold: 85 grams of pure gold.
- Silver: 595 grams of pure silver.
*Which to use?* It is preferred to use the Silver Nisab to determine eligibility because it is lower, which allows more people to contribute and benefits the poor more.

**Q: When is Zakat due?**
A: Zakat is due once one lunar year (Hawl) has passed since you first possessed wealth above the Nisab.
- Calendar: Use the Hijri (lunar) calendar.
- Gregorian Adjustment: If you use the solar (Gregorian) calendar for convenience, you should increase the rate from 2.5% to 2.578% to account for the roughly 11 extra days in the solar year.

## 2. Assets & Calculation

**Q: What is the general Zakat rate?**
A: For most assets (cash, gold, silver, merchandise), the rate is 2.5% of the total value.

**Q: How do I pay Zakat on Cash?**
A: Includes: Cash on hand, checking accounts, savings accounts, and digital currencies.
Calculation: Total amount × 2.5%.

**Q: Do I pay Zakat on Jewelry?**
A:
- Store of Value: If jewelry is kept as an investment or savings (not worn), Zakat is due on its market value (weight of gold/silver only, excluding gems).
- Personal Use: There is a difference of opinion. The safer opinion (The Hanafi school of thought & general texts) is to pay Zakat on all gold/silver jewelry. The other opinion (The Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of thought) exempts jewelry used for personal adornment.
- Calculation: Weight of pure gold/silver × Current price per gram × 2.5%.

**Q: How do I treat Stocks and Investments?**
A:
- Active Trader (Day/Swing Trading): If you buy and sell frequently for short-term profit, treat the entire account value as cash/merchandise. (Total Market Value × 2.5%).
- Passive Investor (Long-term Buy & Hold): If you hold shares for long-term growth and dividends, you only pay on the "zakatable" assets of the company (cash, receivables, inventory).
- The "30% Rule": As a safe approximation for most companies, assume 30% of the company's value is zakatable. (Total Market Value × 30% × 2.5%).

**Q: How do I pay Zakat on Retirement Accounts (401k, IRA)?**
A:
- Accessible Funds (e.g., Roth IRA contributions): Since you can withdraw contributions at any time tax-free, treat this as a long-term investment. Calculation: (Accessible Amount × 30%) × 2.5%.
- Inaccessible/Penalized Funds (e.g., Traditional 401k, Restricted Pensions): If you cannot access the money without a penalty or leaving your job, Zakat is not due year-to-year. You pay only when you actually receive the money. Calculation upon receipt: Amount Received × 2.5%.

**Q: What about Real Estate?**
A:
- Personal Home: Exempt (no Zakat).
- Rental Property: Zakat is due on the net rental income (after expenses), not the property value. Add the saved income to your cash assets.
- Property for Sale (Flipping): Treat as business inventory. Calculation: Current Market Value × 2.5%.
- Land Held for Value (No plans): If you bought land just to park money but have no immediate plan to sell or develop, it is considered an illiquid asset. Calculation: Pay 2.5% on the sales price only when you eventually sell it (one time).

**Q: How is Cryptocurrency treated?**
A: Crypto is treated as currency or merchandise. Calculation: Total Market Value × 2.5%.

## 3. Deducting Expenses & Liabilities

**Q: Can I deduct debts from my wealth before calculating Zakat?**
A:
- Immediate Debts Only: You may deduct debts that are due immediately or within the current month (e.g., this month's mortgage payment, utility bills, credit card balance due).
- Long-Term Debts: You cannot deduct the entire balance of long-term debts like a 30-year mortgage or total student loan balance. Only deduct the payments due now.

**Q: What if I have uncollected money owed to me (Receivables)?**
A:
- Good Debt (Likely to be paid): If the borrower acknowledges the debt and is able to pay, include this amount in your Zakat calculation.
- Bad Debt (Unlikely to be paid): If the borrower denies the debt or is insolvent, do not include it. If you ever receive it, pay Zakat for one year at that time.

## 4. Haram Earnings & Purification

**Q: Do I pay Zakat on Haram (impermissible) income?**
A: No. Allah is Pure and accepts only what is pure. Haram wealth (e.g., interest, gambling winnings) does not count towards your Zakat liability.

**Q: What must I do with Haram earnings?**
A: You must purify your wealth by giving away 100% of the impermissible income to charity. You receive no reward for this donation; it is simply a removal of filth.
- Impure Income in Stocks (Dividends): Calculate the % of impermissible income (often found in financial reports or via apps like Zoya). Donate that percentage of your dividends/gains to charity to purify them. Pay Zakat on the remaining pure value.

## 5. Recipients of Zakat

**Q: Who is eligible to receive Zakat?**
A: There are 8 categories mentioned in the Quran (Surah At-Tawbah: 60):
1. The Poor (Fuqara): Those with absolutely no means.
2. The Needy (Masakin): Those who have some means but not enough to meet basic needs.
3. Zakat Collectors: Officials appointed to collect and distribute.
4. Those whose hearts are to be reconciled: New Muslims or those close to Islam.
5. Freeing Captives: Manumission of slaves or freeing captives.
6. Debtors: Those overwhelmed by personal debt incurred for permissible needs.
7. In the Cause of Allah (Fi Sabilillah): Historically for struggle/defense; scholars also include valid Da'wah.
8. The Wayfarer: A traveler cut off from resources.

**Q: Who CANNOT receive Zakat?**
A:
- The Wealthy: Anyone with sufficient means.
- Immediate Family: You cannot give Zakat to parents, children, or your spouse (you are already obliged to support them). Note: A wife may give Zakat to a needy husband.
- The Family of the Prophet (Banu Hashim).
- Non-Muslims: The majority opinion is Zakat is for poor Muslims. General charity (Sadaqah) can be given to anyone.

## 6. Zakat al-Fitr

**Q: What is Zakat al-Fitr?**
A: A specific charity due at the end of Ramadan to purify the fast and ensure the poor can celebrate Eid.

**Q: Who must pay it?**
A: Every Muslim head of household must pay it on behalf of themselves and their dependents (wives, children, etc.), provided they have food in excess of one day's needs.

**Q: How much is it?**
A: 1 Saa' (approx. 2.5 kg or 5.5 lbs) of staple food (grain, rice, dates, etc.) per person.

**Q: Can I pay in cash?**
A:
- Preferred: Food items, as stated in the Hadith.
- Allowed: The Hanafi school of thought permits paying the cash value if it is more beneficial for the poor. Many scholars allow paying cash to organizations that will then purchase and distribute food.

**Q: When is it due?**
A: It must be paid before the Eid prayer. It can be given a few days before Eid, but delaying it until after the prayer invalidates it as Zakat al-Fitr (it becomes general charity).
