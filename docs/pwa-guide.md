## Best Practices

### For Best Performance

1. **Install the app**: Installed apps load faster
2. **Use WiFi for first visit**: Initial cache download ~3-5MB
3. **Keep app updated**: Updates improve performance
4. **Clear cache occasionally**: If app feels slow

### For Reliable Sync

1. **Don't force close**: Let background sync complete
2. **Stable connection**: Ensure good network when syncing

4. **Avoid rapid edits**: Give app time to sync between changes

### For Privacy

1. **Use strong password**: Protects encryption keys

## FAQs

### Q: Is ZakApp really a native app?

**A**: ZakApp is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it's built with web technologies but provides a native app-like experience. It's not in the app store, but works just like a native app once installed.

### Q: Will it use a lot of data?

**A**: No. After initial installation (~3-5MB), data usage is minimal. Most actions work offline, and sync uses very little data (typically <100KB per session).

### Q: Can I use ZakApp on multiple devices?

**A**: Yes! Install on all your devices. Data syncs automatically across devices when online.

### Q: What happens if I uninstall?

**A**: Your data remains on our secure servers. Reinstall anytime and log in to restore your data.

### Q: Does it drain battery?

**A**: No. PWAs are optimized for battery life. Background sync is minimal and only happens when needed.

### Q: Can I use it without installing?

**A**: Yes! ZakApp works perfectly in your browser. Installing provides extra features (offline, faster loading, home screen icon) but isn't required.

### Q: Is my data safe offline?

**A**: Yes. All data is encrypted on your device with AES-256 encryption. Even if someone accesses your device, they can't read your ZakApp data without your password.
