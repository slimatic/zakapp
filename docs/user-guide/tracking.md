## Creating Your First Snapshot

A **snapshot** is a record of your financial situation at a specific point in time (usually your Zakat anniversary date). Snapshots can be in **draft** or **finalized** status.

1. Click **"Create Snapshot"** button on the dashboard
2. The Create Snapshot form will appear

**Snapshot Date (Gregorian):**
- Select the date for this snapshot (typically your Zakat anniversary)
- Example: January 1, 2024

**Snapshot Date (Hijri):**

**Zakatable Wealth:**
- Auto-calculated: Total Wealth - Total Liabilities
- Example: $150,000 - $20,000 = $130,000

**Zakat Due:**

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is a snapshot?**  
A: A snapshot is a record of your financial situation at a specific point in time, typically your Zakat anniversary. It captures total wealth, liabilities, Zakat due, and asset breakdown.

**Q: Can I have multiple snapshots per year?**  
A: You can create multiple drafts, but typically only one finalized snapshot per year (on your Zakat anniversary).

**Q: What's the difference between draft and finalized?**  
A: Draft snapshots can be edited and deleted. Finalized snapshots are immutable, enable payment tracking, and trigger reminders.

**Q: Can I edit a finalized snapshot?**  
A: No, finalized snapshots are immutable to maintain data integrity. Create a new snapshot if needed.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Yes! All financial data is encrypted end-to-end. ZakApp never sells or shares your data.

### Calculation Questions

**Q: Which methodology should I use?**  
A: Consult with an Islamic scholar familiar with your situation. Most users choose Standard (2.5%) or follow their local community's practice.

**Q: Should I use gold or silver nisab?**  
A: Silver nisab is more inclusive (lower threshold, helps more people). Gold nisab is more conservative. Many scholars recommend silver. Choose based on your preference or consult a scholar.

**Q: How do I calculate zakatable wealth?**  
A: Zakatable Wealth = Total Zakatable Assets - Liabilities. ZakApp auto-calculates this for you.

A: Most scholars treat cryptocurrency as currency, making it zakatable. Include current market value in your calculations.

### Payment Questions

A: There's flexibility in distribution. Consider local needs and consult scholars. ZakApp tracks distribution to help you maintain balance.

**Q: Can I pay Zakat to family members?**  
A: Yes, to extended family members (not parents, children, or spouse). They must fit one of the 8 eligible categories.

**Q: Can I pay Zakat in advance?**  
A: Yes, paying in advance is permissible. ZakApp lets you record payments even before Zakat becomes obligatory.
