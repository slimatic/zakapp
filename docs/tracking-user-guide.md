## Islamic Guidance Notes

### Zakat Calculation Timing

- Annual obligation based on lunar calendar
- Track from your Zakat anniversary date
- Use reminders to stay on schedule

### What Counts as Zakat

Only payments marked with **"Zakat"** category count toward your Zakat obligation. Sadaqah and other categories are voluntary additional giving.

### Recipient Verification

While ZakApp helps you track payments, ensuring recipients are eligible for Zakat is your responsibility. Consult scholars if unsure about recipient eligibility.

### Record Keeping

Islamic tradition encourages keeping records of charitable giving. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized accountability and transparency in financial matters.

### Intention (Niyyah)

Remember that the intention to give for Allah's pleasure is essential. ZakApp helps with the practical tracking, but the spiritual intention is yours to maintain.
