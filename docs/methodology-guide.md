## Understanding Nisab Thresholds

### What is Nisab?
Nisab is the minimum threshold of wealth that makes Zakat obligatory. It's derived from Islamic teachings and represents the minimum amount of wealth above which a Muslim is considered wealthy enough to pay Zakat.

### Current Nisab Values (2024):

| Methodology | Nisab Basis | Approximate USD Value |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Standard | 85g Gold | $4,340 |
| Hanafi | 595g Silver | $2,860 |
| Shafi'i | 85g Gold | $4,340 |
| Custom | Configurable | Variable |

*Note: Values fluctuate with market prices and are updated daily in the application.*

### Why Different Thresholds?

**Gold-based Nisab (Standard/Shafi'i):**
- More stable value over time
- Higher threshold, fewer people obligated
- Aligns with modern economic standards

**Silver-based Nisab (Hanafi):**
- Lower threshold, more people included
- Reflects classical Islamic priority for helping the poor
- More sensitive to market fluctuations

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Methodology

**Assets:**
- Cash: $50,000
- Gold (20g): $1,200
- Stocks: $75,000
- **Total Wealth:** $126,200

**Calculation:**
- Nisab (85g gold): $4,340
- Wealth above Nisab: $126,200 > $4,340 ✅
- Zakat Due: $126,200 × 2.5% = **$3,155**

### Example 2: Hanafi Methodology

**Same Assets:** $126,200 total

**Calculation:**
- Nisab (595g silver): $2,860
- Wealth above Nisab: $126,200 > $2,860 ✅
- Zakat Due: $126,200 × 2.5% = **$3,155**

*Note: Same Zakat amount but lower threshold means obligation begins earlier*

### Example 3: Comparison at Lower Wealth Level

**Assets:** $3,500 total

**Standard/Shafi'i:**
- Nisab: $4,340
- Below Nisab: $3,500 < $4,340
- **Zakat Due: $0**

**Hanafi:**
- Nisab: $2,860
- Above Nisab: $3,500 > $2,860 ✅
- **Zakat Due: $87.50**

## Advanced Considerations

### Debt Handling

**Full Debt Deduction (Standard Approach):**
- Subtract all debts from total wealth
- Calculate Zakat on net wealth
- More lenient approach

**Selective Debt Deduction (Traditional Approach):**
- Deduct only certain types of debt
- Different rules for different debt categories
- More conservative approach

### Business Asset Valuation

**Market Value Method:**
- Use current market prices
- More accurate but complex
- Reflects true wealth

**Cost Basis Method:**
- Use original purchase price
- Simpler but less accurate
- May undervalue assets

### Mixed Asset Portfolios

**Portfolio Example:**
- 40% Cash and equivalents
- 30% Investment securities
- 20% Business assets
- 10% Precious metals

**Calculation Approaches:**
1. **Combined Method:** Total all assets, apply single methodology
2. **Categorical Method:** Calculate each category separately
3. **Weighted Method:** Apply different rules based on asset mix

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I switch methodologies?
**A:** Yes, but maintain consistency within each Zakat year. Switching should be done with valid reasoning and preferably with scholarly consultation.

### Q: What if my wealth fluctuates during the year?
**A:** Most methodologies use the wealth amount on your Zakat anniversary date. Some consider average wealth or minimum wealth held throughout the year.

### Q: How do I handle cryptocurrency?
**A:** Most contemporary scholars treat cryptocurrency like currency, making it zakatable. Use current market value on your Zakat calculation date.

### Q: What about retirement accounts I can't access?
**A:** Generally, only accessible portions are considered zakatable. Locked retirement funds with penalties are often excluded.

### Q: How do I handle international assets?
**A:** Convert all assets to a single currency using exchange rates on your calculation date. Consider any restrictions on fund transfers.

### Q: What if I'm unsure about certain assets?
**A:** When in doubt, lean toward inclusion rather than exclusion. It's better to pay Zakat on questionable assets than to miss an obligation.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Which methodology should I choose as a beginner?
**A:** For most users, the Standard (AAOIFI) methodology is recommended as it provides internationally recognized guidelines and comprehensive coverage of modern assets.

### Q: Can I switch methodologies between years?
**A:** While possible, it's recommended to maintain consistency. If switching, ensure you're not avoiding Zakat obligations and consider consulting a scholar.

### Q: What if my total wealth is close to the nisab threshold?
**A:** If you're consistently near the threshold, use the more conservative estimate. Consider using the Hanafi methodology which typically has a lower threshold.

### Q: How do I handle joint assets with my spouse?
**A:** Each person calculates Zakat on their proportional ownership. For jointly owned assets, determine each person's share based on contribution or legal ownership.

### Q: Do I need to pay Zakat on money I've already paid taxes on?
**A:** Yes, Zakat and taxes are separate obligations. Government taxes do not substitute for Zakat requirements.

### Q: What if I live in a country with different currency?
**A:** Convert all nisab thresholds and asset values to your local currency using current exchange rates. The app handles this conversion automatically.

### Q: How precise do I need to be with calculations?
**A:** Aim for reasonable accuracy. Minor rounding is acceptable, but don't use approximations to avoid Zakat obligations. When in doubt, round up.

### Q: What if I discover I missed Zakat payments in previous years?
**A:** Calculate and pay the missed Zakat for previous years. This is considered Qada (makeup payment) and should be paid as soon as possible.
