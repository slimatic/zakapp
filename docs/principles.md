# Project Principles

The development of zakapp will be guided by the following principles:

- **"Lovable" UI/UX:** The user interface will be crafted with a focus on "lovable" design principles, aiming for a highly modern, intuitive, and engaging user experience. The application should be a pleasure to use.
- **User-Centric Design:** Every feature and design decision will be made with the user's needs and ease of use in mind.
- **Privacy and Security First:** We will prioritize the security and privacy of our users' data through robust authentication, encryption, and a self-hosted architecture.
- **Spec-Driven Development:** We will follow a spec-driven development approach to ensure clarity, alignment, and a high-quality end product. All development work will be guided by the specifications in this repository.
- **Simplicity and Clarity:** The application will aim to simplify the complex process of Zakat calculation, providing clear guidance and explanations at every step, inspired by resources like SimpleZakatGuide.com.
- **Open and Extensible:** While the initial version will be focused on core functionality, the architecture should allow for future extensions and integrations.
