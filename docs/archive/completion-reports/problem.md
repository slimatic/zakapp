# The Problem

Many Muslims find it challenging to accurately and easily calculate their annual Zakat. Existing solutions can be complex, lack a modern user interface, or do not offer the privacy and control of a self-hosted application. This leads to a lack of confidence in Zakat calculations and can be a barrier to fulfilling this important pillar of Islam.

## Key Challenges

- **Complexity of Zakat Calculation:** Zakat rules can be intricate, with different methodologies for various asset types.
- **Poor User Experience:** Many existing tools are not user-friendly, making the process of asset management and Zakat calculation tedious.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Users may be hesitant to entrust their sensitive financial data to third-party applications.
- **Lack of Control:** Cloud-based solutions do not offer the same level of control and data ownership as a self-hosted application.

## Goals

- To create a Zakat application that is easy to use and visually appealing.
- To provide a secure and private way for users to manage their assets and calculate their Zakat.
- To offer a self-hosted solution that gives users full control over their data.
- To build an application that is inspired by the clear and accessible guidance of resources like SimpleZakatGuide.com.
