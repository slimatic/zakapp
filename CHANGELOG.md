### 💱 Currency Consistency — Server-Side Completion of Issue #310

#### Fixed
- **`POST /api/zakat/calculate` now returns results in the user's currency** (#348):
  the engine still computes in USD internally, but every displayed money field is
  converted before the response is sent — `totalAssets`, `totalLiabilities`,
  `netWorth`, `nisabThreshold`, `zakatDue`. An IDR user now sees IDR totals and an
  IDR nisab instead of USD-scale numbers.
- **Breakdown converted too**: `assetsByCategory` totals, per-asset
  `value`/`zakatableValue`/`zakatAmount`, liability amounts, and the
  `methodologyRules.nisabCalculation.effectiveNisab` are all scaled by the same
  `fxRateFromUSD`, so the Detailed Breakdown tab matches the summary
  (independent-review fix B2).
- **Currency resolution chain** (#348): explicit `?currency=`/body `currency` param →
  authenticated user's saved currency preference (decrypted settings blob) → USD
  fallback. Unknown/unsupported currency codes are whitelisted back to USD.
- **`GET /api/zakat/nisab`** now resolves currency from the query param → user
  settings → USD, and returns the resolved `currency` in the response (#348).
- **FX failure path is safe**: if the exchange-rate lookup fails, the response
  falls back to USD and is *labeled* USD — never silently mislabeled (#348).
- **Client call-sites**: `ActiveRecordWidget`, `Dashboard`, `ZakatSetupStep`,
  `MetalsStep`, `AssetList`, `ZakatResults` all pass the user's currency; no
  remaining live call-site hardcodes `'USD'` (`IdentityStep` stays USD by design) (#348).
- **`/api/zakat/nisab` uses optional auth** (review fix B3): pre-auth onboarding
  (`IdentityStep`) and the `/calculator` page keep working; only authenticated
  callers get a preference lookup (#348).
- **Summary arithmetic consistency** (review fix B1): `summary.totalLiabilities` is
  converted with the rest of the summary, so
  `netWorth = totalAssets − totalLiabilities` holds in every currency (#348).

#### API changes
- `summary.zirconYearAmount` removed (renamed `zakatDue`); `zirconYearRate` →
  `zakatRate`. `summary.currency` and `summary.fxRateFromUSD` added.
  Verified: zero remaining consumers of the removed fields repo-wide.

#### Tests
- Server suite: **472 passing** (up from 461: +11 in
  `currencyConsistency310.test.ts` pinning the fix contract — resolution chain,
  FX direction, failure fallback, client call-sites)
- Client suite: unchanged (471 pass / 15 skip) — display-side fixes were already
  in place from the #318/#323 rounds
- Client `tsc --noEmit` clean
